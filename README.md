# Schneider/Merten
Adds support for Schneider/Merten Connect Z-Wave devices.

## Known issues
The Schneider/Merten push buttons are somewhat specific, and need special consideration when configuring.

A push-button device needs to be added to Homey after the device it will control. It cannot control
devices that have higher device id:s than itself.

## Supported and partially supported devices:
- MTN506004, Radio transmitter, 4-gang
- MTN507501, Radio receiver, 1-gang switch
- MTN507900, Radio receiver, 1-gang universal dimmer
- MTN508XXX, Radio push-button, Move
- MTN50X1XX, Radio push-button, 1-gang
- MTN50X2XX, Radio push-button, 2-gang
## Supported Languages:
