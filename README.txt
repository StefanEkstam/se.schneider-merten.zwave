Supports legacy Schneider/Merten Connect Z-Wave devices.

Now you can finally add your old Schneider/Merten devices to Homey!

Please note: The Schneider/Merten push buttons are somewhat specific, and need special consideration when configuring.

A push-button device needs to be added to Homey after the device it will control. It cannot control devices that have higher device id:s than itself.
